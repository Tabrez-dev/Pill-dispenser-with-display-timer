# Pill-dispenser-with-display-timer
Automatic pill dispenser using an IR sensor and a display screen with a timer indicating time of pill last taken.
## Intention behind this project:
To dispense pills inside pill holder automatically when IR sensor is activated.
## Story behind the build:
One of my close relatives is suffering from a disease that makes it difficult to take his medication since his hands have become weak and vibrate uncontrollably. To add to the difficulty the tablets are very small. This was a problem that piqued my interest and I made this project to make his life a little bit easier.

After some research, I noticed that this problem is faced by many people. But all the automatic tablet dispensers are quite expensive in the market as of date. This will also reduce the effort of caretakers to give tablets as they can be loaded once and used multiple times until the tablets get depleted from the dispenser.

## Components and Materials Required:
1. Arduino Nano/Uno
2. PCB/Breadboard
3. Connecting wires
4. Power bank or 9 volt battery
5. Long plastic tube and/or a funnel to hold the tube
6. Infrared Sensor
7. Hot glue gun for hacking things together
8. Cardboard box

## My Expereince and Problems faced during the build:
The main problems faced while making the build was:

1.finding the right material

2.making the exact size hole for tablet and tracking the trajectory of the funnel

3. Getting the code right for the display

First problem was fixed by using a material know as foam board. It is easier to cut than cardboard.
The trajectory that the funnel would take with respect to servo motor was calculated by trial and error. As the saying goes 

> test fast,fail fast and adjust fast.

The issue of the display was fixed by downloading the right library (in this case ada fruit)
