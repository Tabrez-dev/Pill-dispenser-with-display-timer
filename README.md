# Pill-dispenser-with-display-timer
Automatic pill dispenser using an IR sensor and a display screen with a timer indicating time of pill last taken.
## Intention behind this project:
To dispense pills inside pill holder automatically when IR sensor is activated.
## Story behind the build:
One of my close relatives is suffering from a disease that makes it difficult to take his medication since his hands have become weak and vibrate uncontrollably. To add to the difficulty the tablets are very small. This was a problem that piqued my interest and I made this project to make his life a little bit easier.
After some research, I noticed that this problem is faced by many people. But all the automatic tablet dispensers are quite expensive in the market as of date. This will also reduce the effort of caretakers to give tablets as they can be loaded once and used multiple times until the tablets get depleted from the dispenser.
