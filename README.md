# Pill-dispenser-with-display-timer
Automatic pill dispenser using an IR sensor and a display screen with a timer indicating time of pill last taken.
## Intention behind this project:
One of my close relatives is suffering from PD(Parkinsons disease) and it is difficult for him to take the tablets from the cover because of them being so small and his hands being weak. This was a problem that peaked my interest and i made this project to make his life a little bit easier.
